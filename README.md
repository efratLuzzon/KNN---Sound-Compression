# Wine Quality classification -  Knn, Perceptron and PA

### Wine Quality dataset - provided with 12 features per instance and three labels, labels correspond to the wine quality classification.
### In this exercise, I  was implemented and compared K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Perceptron, and PA algorithms.
